# ✅ FlowTasks API

A professional **Task Management REST API** built with **ASP.NET Core**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQL Server**.

This project demonstrates strong backend fundamentals including clean API design, database integration, validation, async operations, and global error handling.

## 🧠 Why this project matters

FlowTasks was built to demonstrate how a real-world backend system should:
- Handle data safely  
- Enforce validation rules  
- Separate concerns using DTOs  
- Respond consistently to errors  
- Remain clean, maintainable, and scalable  

It represents a strong foundation for production-grade APIs.
